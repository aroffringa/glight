There's more...
---------------

This concludes this tutorial. Some of the features not yet covered and that
you might explore next are:

* Timed sequences. Like chases, but with more flexibility. It allows to
  program a series of presets every time the sequence is switched on.
* Effects. This allows making lights flicker like a candle, light up
  on the volume of the music and creating complex logical combinations.
* Many more default designs.
* Structuring your presets, chases and other objects into *folders*. When
  creating complex shows, the number of objects may become very large.
  Hierarchical foldering and naming these appropriately helps to keep them
  easily accessible.
* Using the dry mode. This allows modifying your show while the show runs,
  without affecting the output. 
* Shows can be saved and loaded. This also saves fader groups and fader
  assignment.
